This folder is location of files created in the study of "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python" by Hans Petter Langtangen.

Completed problems are labelled by chapter. The first chapter the problems are labelled according to their
problem number. All other chapters are labelled per the instructions in the problem.

Some problems are skipped. These include but are not limited to problems dealing with manual code 
interruption and problems that reference data or source code that the author compiled but I can't seem to
find.
