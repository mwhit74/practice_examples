Practicing with Python
Programming
I have been learning a new programming language called Python. It is quite interesting and I am developing some new skills like what you see here. Let me explain, I did not post this entry from the web but from a Python script that accesses this website and posts to it. It is quite interesting really. 

What I have found is that the initial language is quite easy to pick up but learning new modules, which are like libraries in C++, is where things tend to get more complicated. This may have something to do with the fact I am not all that experienced in any language with using outside modules. It may also be that the people who write this nice modules are much better than I am so I spend a good amount of my time trying to figure out what they are doing. 

My Winter Break project was to develop a GUI interface for one of these modules  pyPDF which is a lot like the command line interface PDFTK. I am still working towards this goal. Some of the concepts for creating the GUI are slightly advanced and I didn't not think I was going to spend two (or more) weeks reading books online learning about Python.

It has been fun though, frustrating at times but it keeps me from being bored out of my mind and it is interesting. 

...Python, modules.
